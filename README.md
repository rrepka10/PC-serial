# PC-serial
Sample serial communication code for PC DOS and Windows.  This program was tested with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10 64 bit and should run on most current windows machines.  This code will also compile and run under Turboc++ on PC DOS 3.3.  The intent of this code is to demonstrate a simple 2 way (very old)PC to (new)PC connection over the serial port
